Here is a new repo
Hello world. My name is Konrad Young. I am a Senior at the University of Minnesota. I am majoring in technical writing and communication as well as history. My specific area of study is Classical Antiquity (Greece, Rome, etc.). I like reading, playing video games, engaging in smalltalk with other humans, cooking pasta, and talking my dog for walks around the lake. I have some initial background in coding, but have forgotten most of this useful knowledge since the last time I have coded. Nonetheless, I have few doubts that I will be able to remaster the tools of this course.
